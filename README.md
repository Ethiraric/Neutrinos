Neutrinos
=========

This is a math project I undertook with [Kratinos](https://github.com/Kratinos).
The project in itself is of no real interest.

Made with [Dogescript](https://dogescript.com/), a language translated into Javascript.

`dogescript` and `rhino` (one may choose a different js interpreter) are required.
